# A Chapter 11 filing refers to a part of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code that allows businesses, and in some cases individuals, to reorganize their debts and assets. This type of filing is often referred to as "reorganization bankruptcy." Here's a breakdown:

# Reorganization: The primary goal is to keep the business alive and pay creditors over time.

# Debtor in Possession: The company typically remains in control of its operations and assets but must seek court approval for major business decisions.

# Automatic Stay: Creditors are temporarily halted from collecting debts, giving the business time to propose a reorganization plan.

# Plan of Reorganization: The business must develop a plan to restructure its debts, which must be approved by the creditors and the bankruptcy court.

# Debt Restructuring: The plan might include reducing debts, changing payment terms, or other measures to make the business viable.

# Chapter 11 is more complex and expensive than other types of bankruptcy, such as Chapter 7 (liquidation) or Chapter 13 (repayment plan for individuals), but it can provide a valuable opportunity for businesses to get back on their feet.
